Building Spring SecurityJust follow the steps below to build Spring Security. This is often the simplest way of working with the sample applications.
Spring Security now uses Gradle for building (version 1.0-milestone-1 or later is required). You don't need to have gradle installed in order to use it since we take advantage of gradle's "wrapper" script. Assuming you've already checked the source out from git, just run the command
  gradlew build

from the project root directory to build the jars (you will need an internet connection, in order to download required dependencies). If you want to install the jars in your local Maven repository, you can then run
  gradlew install（安装到maven库）

or you can run both tasks at the same time, like so
  gradlew build install



./gradlew build –x test 忽略测试代码
